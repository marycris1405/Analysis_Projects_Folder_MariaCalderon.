## Background

To create a new list of potential mentors, you will need to create a query that returns a list of current employees eligible for retirement, as well as their most recent titles. To get the final list with the recent titles, you’ll also need to partition the data so that each employee is only included on the list once. In addition, you’ll need to perform a query that shows how many current employees of each title are presently eligible for retirement. The final query should return the potential mentor’s employee number, first and last name, their title, birth date and employment dates.

The ERD graph allows us to see the relationships between the tables, execute correctly the code and locate better the Primary Key and Foreign Key.

## SQL

The following images will show the code executed as well as its output. To see the csv files please check the 'CHALLENGE' folder.

The following challenge goals is to:
 * Use an ERD to understand relationships between SQL tables.
 * Create new tables in pgAdmin by using different joins.
 * Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
 * Export new tables to a CSV file.

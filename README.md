## Background

Create a new list of potential mentors, you will need to create a query that returns a list of current employees eligible for retirement, as well as their most recent titles. To get the final list with the recent titles, you’ll also need to partition the data so that each employee is only included on the list once. In addition, you’ll need to perform a query that shows how many current employees of each title are presently eligible for retirement. The final query should return the potential mentor’s employee number, first and last name, their title, birth date and employment dates.
